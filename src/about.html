      <h2>About Composed Calendar</h2>
      <p>
        Often people get lost in the moment and plan too many things at once. They either find themselves overwhelmed with what they have to get done, or things aren't prioritized in their mind/dayplanner. Prioritization is so important to me, for example:
        <br> - being reminded that visiting your grandma is more important than cleaning your car (depends on the car)
        <br><br>
        This app is designed to make tasks throughout the day fun and rewarding to do. I want this to be accessible to anyone, basic yet functional.
        <br><br>
        My hope with this app, is to make the User experience to feel as though they have their life under control, and things that are more important to be prioritized, making them feel composed.

    <!-- Sub-Content (Future Features) -->
    <div class="container row col-md-4 col-md-offset-1" style="padding-bottom:350px;padding-top:150px;">
      <h4>Features that I would like to incorporate</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to add a difficulty meter to each task</li>
        <li>An edit button, so that you could edit the task that you clicked on</li>
        <li>A day would only allow so much difficulty</li>
        <li>If the difficulty that you add excedes the max allowed difficulty on that day, it would automatically push to the next available day</li>
        <li>A complete task button, that would remove the task from the day</li>
        <li>Using storage to store data so the User won't have to input tasks every single day</li>

      </ul>
