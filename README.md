## What is Composed Calendar?

###### This project was designed during the first Unit of Gschool, and to make tasks throughout the day fun and rewarding to do.

## How does it work?

###### You are able to click on any date and input a task with details ranging from a description, to when the task needs to be completed. Once Created, you can drag that task to other dates if you aren't able to complete it. Once the task is completed, you can click on that task, and a modal will drop down showing you all of the specific data about that task!
